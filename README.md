# The Mothership

This is a massive mothership repository that contains all of the materials to be hosted on gdichicago.com.

It also contains the static pages for the site.

### Updating & Adding New Repositories for GDI Chicago Courses

Run [this Ruby script](https://github.com/gdichicago/course-updater) in the `courses/` directory; it has a .csv source that contains the repositories of all current GDI Chicago courses. If you already have the repo present in the `courses/` directory, it will fetch latest for that repo. There are also directions on adding new repos to this script.

### Deployment

Changes merged into the `stable` branch are automatically deployed.
